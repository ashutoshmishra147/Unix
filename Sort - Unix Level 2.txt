Examples:

Assume the below initial contents of file1.txt for the following examples

01 Priya
04 Shreya
03 Tuhina
02 Tushar

Sort with default ordering:

$ sort file1.txt
01 Priya
02 Tushar
03Tuhina
04 Shreya
In this example, the sorting is first performed using the first character. Since this is the same for all lines,
 the sorting then proceeds to the second character. Since the second character is unique for each line, the sorting ends there.

Sort in reverse ordering:

$ sort -r file1.txt
04 Shreya
03Tuhina
02 Tushar
01 Priya
In this example, the sorting is done similar to the above example, but the result is in the reverse order.

Sort by the second field:

$ sort -k 2 file1.txt
01 Priya
04Shreya
03Tuhina
02 Tushar
Now assume the original file2.txt is as below

01 Priya
01 Pooja
01 Priya
01 Pari

Sort with default ordering

$ sort file2.txt
01 Pari
01 Pooja
01Priya
01Priya
Sort suppressing repeated lines

$ sort -u file2.txt
01 Pari
01 Pooja
01Priya
Conclusion

The Sort command in Unix is a filter command that sorts the input text and prints the result to stdout.
